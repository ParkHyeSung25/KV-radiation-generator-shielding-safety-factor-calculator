The program was developed based on Python and the NCRP-49 shielding calculation methodology. (This program is a temporary version for public use)


The attenuation curve data in NCRP49 etc report were converted into a table, and with the HVL/TVL tables, they were converted into two-dimensional arrays (transmission factor and barrier thickness) corresponding to energy and material.


The user can select the type of barrier and radiation (primary, leakage, or scattering beam and secondary barrier) to be evaluated, and the factors used for the shielding calculation (workload, design exposure rate, use factor, etc.) are input to calculate the transmission factor and barrier thickness.
